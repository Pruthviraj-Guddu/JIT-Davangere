          A <strong>computer</strong> is an electronic device which accepts
          input from the user in the form of data and instructions, processes
          it, and produces output.

          <p>
            In Von Neumann architecture, data and instructions are stored in the

            slower.

      <!-- Basic Organization of Computers -->
<div class="card">
  <h2 class="subsection-title">Basic Organization of Computers</h2>
  <p>
    A computer is an electronic device that performs five major operations: 
    <strong>Input, Storage, Processing, Output, and Control</strong>. 
    These operations are coordinated by the CPU and supported by input/output devices and memory units.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Input -->
<div class="card">
  <h3 class="subsection-title">Input</h3>
  <p>
    Input is the process of entering data and instructions into a computer system.
    Various devices can be used to provide input:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> Standard and numeric keys for text and number entry.</li>
    <li><strong>Mouse, Trackball, Touchpad:</strong> Pointing devices to control cursor movement.</li>
    <li><strong>Scanner, Barcode Reader, OCR, OMR:</strong> Convert physical data into digital format.</li>
    <li><strong>Microphone and Camera:</strong> For audio and visual input.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Input devices convert user data into <strong>binary code (0s and 1s)</strong>, which the computer can understand.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Storage -->
<div class="card">
  <h3 class="subsection-title">Storage</h3>
  <p>
    Storage is the process of saving data and instructions for processing. Computers have two main types of storage:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Primary Storage (Main Memory):</strong> Directly accessible by the CPU at high speed. Stores data, programs, and intermediate results. Example: RAM. <em>Volatile: Data is lost when the computer is turned off.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Secondary Storage (Auxiliary Memory):</strong> Permanent storage for data and programs not currently in use. Cheaper and non-volatile. Example: Hard Disk Drives (C: and D: drives), SSDs.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- Processing -->
<div class="card">
  <h3 class="subsection-title">Processing</h3>
  <p>
    Processing is the act of performing operations on data according to instructions provided by the user program. 
    Data moves between <strong>main memory</strong> and the <strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</strong> multiple times until processing is complete.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Output -->
<div class="card">
  <h3 class="subsection-title">Output</h3>
  <p>
    Output is the process of presenting processed data to the user in a readable form.
    Output devices convert binary results from the CPU into human-readable format.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Displays text, images, and videos.</li>
    <li><strong>Printer:</strong> Produces hard copies of documents.</li>
    <li><strong>Speakers:</strong> Output for audio signals.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- Control -->
<div class="card">
  <h3 class="subsection-title">Control</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>Control Unit (CU)</strong> acts like the nervous system of the computer, coordinating and managing all components.
    <strong>CPU = CU + ALU</strong>. The ALU performs calculations and logic operations, while the CU activates and monitors input, output, and memory.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Inside the Computer -->
<div class="card">
  <h3 class="subsection-title">Inside the Computer</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CPU:</strong> The brain of the computer, performing all calculations and coordinating other devices. Faster CPU = quicker program execution.</li>
    <li><strong>RAM:</strong> Temporary memory used by currently running programs. More RAM allows multiple applications to run smoothly.</li>
    <li><strong>Hard Disk Drive (HDD):</strong> Permanent storage for data, documents, and programs. Larger drives store more information.</li>
    <li><strong>Video Card:</strong> Generates images for display. High-end cards have their own RAM and processors for multimedia or gaming.</li>
    <li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Enables audio output and input for speakers and microphones.</li>
    <li><strong>Modem:</strong> Connects the computer to the Internet via telephone lines.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Card:</strong> Connects the computer to other computers or networks for data transfer.</li>
    <li><strong>Fans & Cables:</strong> Keep the system cool and provide power/communication between components.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- Input Devices -->
<div class="card">
  <h3 class="subsection-title">Input Devices</h3>
  <p>
    Input devices allow users to interact with the computer. They can be categorized as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> Main input device for text and numbers. Advantages: Easy and inexpensive. Disadvantages: Cannot draw; cursor movement is slow.</li>
    <li><strong>Pointing Devices:</strong> Mouse, trackball, joystick, touchpad. Used to control cursor, select commands, and draw graphics. Faster and more intuitive than keyboard for graphical operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Other Devices:</strong> Scanners, OCR, OMR, barcode readers, cameras, microphones for multimedia input.</li>
  </ul>
